## 🧩 PROJECT TITLE

**GateKeeper: Pluggable Policy-as-Code Layer for RAG Applications**

---

## 🧠 CORE IDEA

GateKeeper is a **framework-agnostic governance layer** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
It enforces **security, compliance, and content policies** across the entire RAG flow — from user query to final generated response — without requiring changes to application logic.

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

To build a **pluggable, customizable, and auditable** middleware that:

1. Prevents **data leakage** (PII, confidential info).
2. Enforces **role- and attribute-based access control**.
3. Ensures **answer integrity** (citations, confidence thresholds).
4. Provides **policy-as-code** management with versioning and CI validation.
5. Optionally converts **natural-language rules** into executable JSON/YAML policies.

---

## 🔧 ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

GateKeeper sits as an **interception layer** between the user, the LLM, and the retrieval system (vector database or hybrid search).
It governs every major step in a RAG pipeline through **four enforcement hooks**:

1. **Pre-Query** — before the RAG system processes the user’s question.
2. **Pre-Retrieval** — before document retrieval.
3. **Post-Retrieval** — after retrieval but before sending data to the LLM.
4. **Post-Generation** — after the LLM produces an output but before returning it to the user.

A **Policy Server/Registry** manages versioned policies, and a **Dashboard (Rules Studio)** enables both technical and non-technical users to define and test rules visually.

## ⚙️ FEATURE BREAKDOWN

### 🟡 1. Pre-Query Enforcement

**Stage Purpose:** Control and sanitize user queries before any retrieval or model call.
**Capabilities:**

* **Block** restricted or risky queries (e.g., “What is the CEO’s salary?”).
* **Rewrite** queries (e.g., convert “Show me all HR data” → “Show me HR summary”).
* **Rate-limit / quota control** per role or time window.
* **Intent detection** for sensitive topics using rule-based or LLM classification.
* **Logging & feedback:** blocked queries are logged with reason and suggested phrasing.

---

### 🟠 2. Pre-Retrieval Enforcement

**Stage Purpose:** Control which documents, indexes, or metadata scopes are queried.
**Capabilities:**

* **Scope narrowing:** add metadata filters (e.g., `department=HR`, `region=EU`).
* **Access restrictions:** restrict retrieval from specific KBs for interns/guests.
* **Dynamic filtering:** apply time, region, or device-based conditions.
* **Break-glass override:** temporary elevated access with TTL & justification.
* **Query shaping:** adjust retrieval parameters (similarity threshold, top-k) per user tier.

---

### 🟢 3. Post-Retrieval Enforcement

**Stage Purpose:** Sanitize the retrieved chunks before they are fed into the LLM.
**Capabilities:**

* **PII redaction:** remove personal identifiers (emails, PAN, phone, names).
* **Content redaction:** mask sensitive sections (`tags: confidential`, `salary`).
* **Role-based chunk filtering:** hide high-sensitivity docs from lower-privilege roles.
* **Summary degradation:** downgrade restricted content to summaries instead of blocking completely.
* **Source validation:** drop documents with invalid metadata or outdated timestamps.
* **Audit tagging:** mark which rules modified which chunks.

---

### 🔵 4. Post-Generation Enforcement

**Stage Purpose:** Inspect and control final model output before delivery to the user.
**Capabilities:**

* **Citation enforcement:** require at least one valid source per factual answer.
* **Confidence gating:** block or degrade answers below confidence threshold.
* **Tone and style control:** ensure formal, non-toxic, non-biased language.
* **Output redaction:** detect and mask leaked PII or sensitive terms in generated text.
* **Fallback responses:** replace blocked outputs with safe responses (e.g., “This information is restricted.”).
* **Structured logging:** store full rule trace (which rules triggered, what actions taken).

---

### ⚫ 5. Audit & Metrics Layer

**Purpose:** Provide observability and accountability.
**Capabilities:**

* **Structured logs:** who/what/when/why per enforcement.
* **Rule-trigger analytics:** frequency, latency impact, success ratio.
* **Policy version linkage:** every audit entry tied to policy hash/version.
* **Prometheus metrics:** counters for blocked queries, redactions, latency.
* **Grafana dashboard** for live monitoring.

---

### 🟣 6. Policy Definition & Management (Policy-as-Code)

**Purpose:** Store and version all rules in machine-readable, testable form.
**Capabilities:**

* **YAML/JSON policy schema:** declarative rules (stage, condition, action, message).
* **RBAC/ABAC attributes:** user.role, user.department, time, location, network.
* **Static validation:** policy syntax and dependency checks before deploy.
* **Test harness:** run policies against synthetic data to verify behavior.
* **GitOps integration:** commit + CI pipeline runs `policy-lint` and `policy-test`.
* **Policy priority & conflict resolution:** deterministic rule evaluation order.

---

### 🟣 7. Natural Language → Policy Compiler (Stretch Goal)

**Purpose:** Let admins define rules in plain English.
**Flow:**

1. User writes: *“Interns should only see HR summaries.”*
2. LLM converts it to structured YAML/JSON policy.
3. Compiler runs validation → stores in policy registry.
4. Dashboard shows both original NL rule + generated policy for review.
   **Use cases:** Non-technical stakeholders (HR, Compliance, Legal) can define data-access constraints without writing code.

---

### 🟤 8. Rules Studio (Frontend Dashboard)

**Purpose:** Provide a UI for policy authoring, simulation, and deployment.
**Capabilities:**

* Visual builder for stage → condition → action pipeline.
* Import/export policies to YAML/JSON.
* Version comparison (diff view).
* Real-time simulation: test a query under different roles and see decisions.
* Integrates with Policy Server via REST APIs.
* Optional NLP text box → compile → preview → approve → publish.

---

### ⚪ 9. Policy Server / Registry

**Purpose:** Central repository of versioned and signed policies.
**Capabilities:**

* REST/GraphQL APIs for policy retrieval by version/hash.
* JWT-based auth for policy pull requests.
* Policy versioning and rollback.
* Deployment environments: dev, staging, prod.
* Optional signing of policies for tamper-proof enforcement.

---

### 🟢 10. DevOps & Compliance Integration

**Purpose:** Bring governance to CI/CD and runtime monitoring.
**Capabilities:**

* **CI action:** run `policy-lint` and `policy-test` during pull requests.
* **Admission control:** optional Kubernetes webhook rejecting unsafe deploys.
* **Runtime monitoring:** export metrics + alerts (policy blocks, latency spikes).
* **Compliance reporting:** monthly audit exports (policy usage, rule triggers).

---

### ⚫ 11. Plug-and-Play SDK / API Layer

**Purpose:** Allow quick integration with any RAG system.
**Design:**

* **Python SDK:** native call `enforce(stage, user_ctx, data)`.
* **HTTP mode:** language-agnostic POST `/enforce?stage=post_retrieval`.
* **Adapters:** LangChain / LlamaIndex / Haystack connectors.
* **Custom metadata support:** any doc tags or user attributes.
* **Stateless enforcement engine** → easy scaling in containers.

---

### 🧩 12. Optional Components

* **PII / NER Helper Service:** lightweight microservice performing NER-based masking.
* **Ontology / Tag Mapper:** maps document tags to access levels.
* **Policy Evaluator CLI:** local tool to test and debug policies.

---

## 🧱 TECH STACK (non-binding for now)

**Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
**Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript, shadcn/ui)
**Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite for metadata; FAISS or PGVector for vector store.
**LLM:** OpenAI GPT, Groq, or local Llama (for NL→Policy + redaction classification).
**Observability:** Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry.
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Docker + optional K8s webhook.

---

## 🗺️ DATA FLOW SUMMARY

1. **User submits query + context.**
2. **Pre-Query hook** checks for disallowed content → block or sanitize.
3. **Pre-Retrieval hook** scopes the vector search by metadata filters.
4. **Vector DB** performs similarity search → returns candidate chunks.
5. **Post-Retrieval hook** redacts or drops sensitive info → passes safe context to LLM.
6. **LLM** generates draft answer → **Post-Generation hook** validates citations, confidence, tone.
7. **Policy Engine** logs every enforcement → sends decision trace to **Audit Sink**.
8. **Final answer** returned to user (safe, compliant).
9. **Rules Studio** → updates policies → **Policy Server** → propagates new version to engine.

## 🔒 EXAMPLE POLICY (conceptual)

```yaml
- name: restrict-salary-info
  stage: post_retrieval
  when:
    any:
      - user.role != "HR"
  match:
    doc.tags: ["salary", "confidential"]
  action:
    type: redact
    fields: ["amount", "employee_name"]
    message: "Salary data masked for your role."
```
